          Between the light flooding in from the [door] behind you, and the dim room
          light, your eyes cannot help but alight upon the most horrific sight you have
          ever witnessed. Someone did something atrociously vile within this room.

        You remember that movie by Stanely Kubrick with the apes smashing
        skulls open with bones and all the monotonous breathing during the
        space scenes? There were these massive monoliths therein. This door
        is, most decidedly, almost completely, but not quite, exactly not
        like that at all.
      hint: >
        Perhaps you should try touching the door...

      description: >
        Think about the most anti-climatic thing you have ever witnessed.
        Now imagine that times, I dunno, five. That's what the hallway bathed
        in the dim glow of an emergency light looks like: a big disappointment.

        Now that the door is open, perhaps you should use it...

  scenery:

    requires: detox-power
    description: >
      They seemed to have left some pretty grisly handiwork behind, anyway: 
      in the center of the room, hanging from the roof by his own entrails
      are the remains of the very dead [Sergeant Lampig].
    events:
    - action: inspect
      update:

      description: >
        If it weren't for the fact that Lampig is, very much so, dead, you would
        be rather much in awe of the bemusedly grisly fashion of his demise. Lampig's
        chest appears to have been cut open --- or perhaps something burst out of it.
        Whichever the case, he looks as flayed as a frog in a classic biology disection
        lab. His ribcage appears to be bent outward. Lampig's intestines were wrapped
        around his neck before being welded to the ceiling with ProgMatt.

              You never fail to marvel at how retro the present is: humanity has left
              the erstwhile prison of its homeworld; it has managed to build orbiting
              habitats around the planets within the solar system; it somehow managed
              to develop ProgMatt. Yet, rudimentary slabs of plastic are still used
              for identification purposes. Hab Keycards are a bit different from what
              past societies had, though: they communicate using near field technology
              with locks, and are clonable if you have the proper permissions. Still,
              nothing stops you from more low-tech approaches of acquisition.

            An amorphous, chunky broth of vomit and piss about two meters in diameter
            lays still and, well, smelly, near the corpse of Lampig. The hue of the
            pool is rather intoxicatingly beautiful: a rather lovely shade of puke
            yellow with some mixtures of blood red swirling throughout; the chunks
            are, well, chunky. You cannot remember what you ate last night. Fish, maybe?

            You appear to have ate a considerable quantity of a chicken curry; that's
            what those blobby chunks are. Although... one of them could be your gall
            bladder. Odd... there does not appear to be any rice in the mixture.
            You also seem to have chased the curry down with a rather prodigious amount
            of both the green dragon and the green fairy. Why is the pool yellow, then?
            Truly, your excretory system is a, er, "marvel" of epic proportions!

        After a night of drunken debauchery, you wake in a cold, dark room, with
        naught to be seen save a dim red glow emanating from what your throbbing
        head registers as somewhere around the floor. A faintly sweet smell drifts
        about the room, which you find oddly familiar; closer to your immediate
        position, the all too familiar amalgamated stench of vomit and piss is,
        besides the headache, your only clue that the last night was expensive.

        Your eyes bulge in terror: while the lights are now on, it appears that
        someone is very much at home. Or, at least, was at home.
    - else: >
        Your knees start to tremble and shake; the damp warmness betwixt your legs
        is a shocking reminder that you hate the dark. The briefest of whimpers
        escapes your normally stoic face. You, good son, are a feckless wimp.
