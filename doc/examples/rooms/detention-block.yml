        These doors are not anything fancy: standard fare for the
        space-station. When opened, the door retracts into the wall
        beside it. You note that the doors are not hermetically sealed,
        a fact which has always struck you as a bit odd; wouldn't it
        be easier to prevent explosive decompression of the entire
        station if the doors themselves formed a tight barrier? Probably
        a case of some corporate bureaucrat somewhere trimming the fat
        while padding his super-secret offshore account.

        You blearily make out that there is a [light switch] next to the door.

              You see the dim glow of more emergency lighting coming from
              beneath the door to your erstwhile cell.

              The lighting in the cell is no more. It has gone to meet its maker.
              It is pushing up the daises. It has joined the choir invisible.
              It is an ex-lighting.

      At the far end of the hall from where you are standing, you can see 
      the [opening] to the security station.

        From your current vantage point, you cannot see much in the security station;
        however, what you can see seems rather ramshackle. What the hell happened around
        here, anyway? HabSec may be rather porcine, at times, but they are nothing
        if not fastidious when it comes to keeping their stations tidy.

    You find yourself in a short hallway. Even though it is rather dim, 
    the red glow of the emergency lighting is harsh in your still mildly
    inebriated state.
