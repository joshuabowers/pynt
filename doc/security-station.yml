        Many of the public spaces in the Hab sport intricately etched glass surfaces: these
        particular doors feature the following inscription: <HabSec - A-L5<. While some of
        the etchings use more traditional methods, many of the newer sections of the Hab were
        produced through ProgMatt.

            The door doesn't seem to be responsive to any of your machinations; it's
            probably keyed to a HabSec officer.

    This room is better illuminated than the [hallway], in no small part thanks to light
    streaming in from the [glass doors] leading to the market arcade.
    
    You find the security station in utter shambles: desks askew (with a few overturned), 
    chairs flung haphazardly; the accumulated junk of several overworked HabSec Officers, 
    normally held in a state of suspended chaos in cubicles, now littering the floor in no
    discernable order. The room appears to have been struck by a very powerful, very localized
    meterological event. A musty smell permeates the air; inhaling through your mouth, the
    tangy residue of some unknown substance taints your already befouled tongue.
