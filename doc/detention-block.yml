            "These doors are not anything fancy: standard fare for the
            space-station. When opened, the door retracts into the wall
            beside it. You note that the doors are not hermetically sealed,
            a fact which has always struck you as a bit odd; wouldn't it
            be easier to prevent explosive decompression of the entire
            station if the doors themselves formed a tight barrier? Probably
            a case of some corporate bureaucrat somewhere trimming the fat
            while padding his super-secret offshore account."

            beneath the door to your erstwhile cell. You can probably see
            things in there, now."

    "You find yourself in a short hallway. Even though it is rather dim, 
    the red glow of the emergency lighting is harsh in your still mildly
    inebriated state. Behind you is the [door] to the detox cell you had
    spent the night in. You blearily make out that there is a
    [light switch] next to the door."
