            "These doors are not anything fancy: standard fare for the
            space-station. When opened, the door retracts into the wall
            beside it. You note that the doors are not hermetically sealed,
            a fact which has always struck you as a bit odd; wouldn't it
            be easier to prevent explosive decompression of the entire
            station if the doors themselves formed a tight barrier? Probably
            a case of some corporate bureaucrat somewhere trimming the fat
            while padding his super-secret offshore account."
